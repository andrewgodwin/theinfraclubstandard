# Disposable Earplugs

Your hearing is important, and if it gets damaged it won't come back. We have different recommendations on earplugs for different environments:

* **Sleeping**: Hearos Extreme
* **Gigs/Live Events**: Honeywell Laser Lite or 3M EAR

## Member Tips

* While these are the best, any hearing protection is better than nothing, as long as it's actually of decent quality.
