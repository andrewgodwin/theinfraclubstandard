# Bambu A1 Mini

Sometimes, what you want from a 3D printer is something that is cheap and Just Works, and the [Bambu Lab A1 Mini](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini) is our standard 3D printer for exactly that reason.

Coming in at Â£169/$200 for the printer by itself, it's cheap enough to enter dangerous impulse buy territory, but also comes with a great list of other features for the discerning infraclub member - near-silent (you can barely hear it when it's only a metre away from you), auto-levelling and vibration compensation, and optional multi-filament support with the AMS Lite unit.

Plus, on top of that, it just... prints. No careful tuning or fiddling with extrusion parameters, just dump your model in, set a few basic slicer settings if you want, and hit print.

## Member Tips

* The A1 Mini needs a clear space of 51cm deep by 40cm wide to operate in (the actual footprint is smaller than this, but the bed and axis movements push the required space out).

* The printer ejects small filament piles (often called "poops") to the left; you'll want a small container around to catch these (or print one as one of your first prints)
