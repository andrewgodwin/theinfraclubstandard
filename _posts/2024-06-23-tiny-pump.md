# Flextail Tiny Pump 2X

The days of manually inflating your airbed, tent or giant rubber duck are over; the [Flextail Tiny Pump 2X](https://www.flextail.com/products/tiny-pump-2x) packs an absolutely ridiculous amount of airflow into a really small form factor.

Not only will it inflate and deflate, but it's also got a light, a magnet, and a general sense of punching way above its (rather tiny) weight.

## Member Tips

* It's not just for blowing things up; the tiny pump also works well to get extra air into a campfire to really get it going.
