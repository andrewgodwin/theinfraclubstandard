# Radiacode 102

Want to know how spicy a rock is? Curious if your local hacker festival has an orphan source? The [Radiacode 102](https://www.radiacode.com/#models) is our choice for a portable, versatile radiation detector (Geiger counter).

While out of the box it boots up in a click-based, Geiger-like mode, it offers much more - a dosimeter, spectrum analysis, GPS-based logging of activity, and more.

It's USB-C rechargeable, pairs with your phone via Bluetooth, and is small and light enough to just carry around with you - as any good Infraclub member does.

## Member Tips

* The default dosimeter alarm is set rather low; you may want to increase it. Or turn it off if you send the device through an X-ray machine while on.
