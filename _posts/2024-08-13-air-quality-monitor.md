# Awair Element

There's a lot of options when it comes to air quality monitors, but in our experience the [Awair Element](https://www.getawair.com/products/element) is a pretty good device to end up on.

It features pretty accurate temperature, humidity, CO2, TVOC and PM2.5 sensors, has a reasonable app, and has a "local API" you can enable via the app that can be fed directly into Home Assistant (or other home automation platforms.)

## Member Tips

* If a sensor does fail, it's possible to replace them inside the device rather than buy a whole new one.

* Awair Elements were the subject of a weird cryptocurrency at one point and so you can often find good deals on them used.
