# The Standard

The Standard is a small site where we gather recommendations from the Infrastructure Club community and publish them so we can all easily reference them when we forget.

It's available at https://thestandard.infrastructureclub.org/


## Contributing

The Standard is written as a pretty simple GitHub Pages Jekyll site; to add entries, all that's needed is to add a new post and commit it. The site will rebuild and deploy automatically.

To add a new item:

* Copy the example template in `_posts/template.md.example` to a new path based on the item category - e.g. `_posts/2025-01-01-dome.md`

* Edit the template to add the relevant details

* Get a nice picture of the item and add a reasonable-size JPEG of it into `images/posts/item-name.jpg`

* Ensure the image path in the post matches

* Submit a pull request for review and merge!
