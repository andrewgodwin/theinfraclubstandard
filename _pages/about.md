For many years, the members of the [Infrastructure Club](https://infrastructureclub.org) have shared our favourite gadgets, tools and devices amongst ourselves, and clear favourites have emerged.

As we joked about these "standard issue" items, the set of them became cultural memory; often, we knew that there was something that everyone else liked, but couldn't remember exactly what it was.

So, here, we chronicle what the Infrastructure Club has collectively agreed upon - items that we think are the best in their category, by virtue of some combination of price, features, design, or just how much we enjoy using them.
